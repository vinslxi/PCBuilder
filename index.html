		<p>A computer is an electronic object, which is aimed at keeping, retrieving, and processing information.
		The computer was first known as a term that was used to denote human beings who carried out complicated 
		mathematical operations using a device like the abacus or slide rule. Gradually, these tasks started to 
		be performed by mechanical devices and the name of the machine was called the computer. Today, computers 
		are electronic in their processing of data, and they operate in the same way as the simple functions of 
		input, processing, output, and storage, usually referred to as the IPOS cycle. A computer is an electronic 
		machine that involves data processing and execution of tasks based on a collection of instructions known as a program. 
		It receives input either as input of the user or any other source, processes  it, and gives back the output in a convenient form.
		</p>
		
		<P>Hardware is defined as the physical objects including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices and input/output 
		peripherals. Software conversely contains programs and operating systems that give directions to the hardware. Computers
		can do many tasks such as simple calculation to the complex simulations and data analysis. They can process binary code a 
		system of ones and zeros to process and handle information. The use of modern computers has become important in virtually 
		all the spheres of our daily life education, communication, business, science and entertainment. Computers come in various 
		categories, including desk computers, laptop computers, tablets, and server computers that have different applications. An 
		example would be the use of supercomputers in scientific research where it would be imperative to have enormous processing 
		power. In general, a computer is an essential device that will help increase productivity, better decision-making and will 
		unite people all over the globe with the help of digital technology.<br><br>

		<p>The use of computers is very important to study in the current digital world. They have become necessities in virtually all
		spheres of life such as education, business, healthcare, science, and entertainment. Learning the functioning of computers contributes 
		to the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and logical thinking, that would be useful in any profession. Education related 
		to computers gives access to high paying and high demand careers, including software development, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence,
		and data science. Having great computer skills, one will be able to develop applications, construct websites, deal with systems, or even 
		develop new technologies that will enhance the lives of people. Besides, computers do not exist alone in the technical sphere they are also 
		utilized in such areas as art, money, engineering, and communication. Both students and professionals use computers and their services in 
		research, design, data analysis, and creative projects. In the current world of high paces and globalization, computer literacy enables people 
		to embrace change well and be very innovative. Education of computers does not only increase career prospects but also provides people with 
		the resources that will enable them to survive in a fast-paced digital society. Simply put, knowledge of computers will make you more adaptable,
		innovative and future-minded.<br><br>

		<p>The computer history can be traced back to the early inventions of mankind, which were made to make counting, calculation and record keeping
		easier. The abacus was one of the earliest known devices and it was invented thousands of years ago to perform simple arithmetic operations. 
		Over time, there were more elaborate machines created to solve mathematical problems more effectively. Charles Babbage was an inventor and English 
		mathematician who in the 19th century designed the Analytical Engine which is frequently considered as the first concept of a programmable mechanical 
		computer. His invention brought about the concept of utilizing memory and processing units which are major characteristics of modern day computers. In 
		the middle of the 20 th century, the first electronic computers were constructed by use of vacuum tubes. They were also gigantic and devoured a lot of 
		electricity, but they were faster than the previous mechanical models. This was later overtaken by the revolution of the industry in the 1950s and 1960s 
		through the invention of transistors and microchips, which made computers smaller, faster, and more reliable. Nowadays, computers are also designed by 
		sophisticated individuals, and they can be assembled using components manufactured in different parts of the globe, especially silicon chips produced in 
		places like China, Taiwan, and the U.S.<br><br>
