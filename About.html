        <h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>I am Elijah Vinson, and I strongly admire the technology that runs our world today. 
		I developed this site to inform other people about how computers function internally,
		the functions of their internal parts and how engineering principles allow them to
		perform effectively. It is important to know the functionality of every component; 
		CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and power supply just to mention a few, to anyone who wishes 
		to build or upgrade his/her own computer. It is important to me to make this information 
		clear, accurate and easy to understand even by the people who are new to the computer 
		hardware field. While learning about system design and performance optimization, I have
		become deeply interested in the interaction between hardware and software to produce
		balanced, high-performance systems. I can say that assembling a computer is not only an 
		effective technique but also a means of training problem-solving skills and gaining a better 
		understanding of the entire technology. Here, you can read in-depth descriptions, build tutorials,
		and tips that are easily understood to make better choices when choosing parts or debugging 
		problems. Whether it is your first PC or you are seeking the know-how of how your existing 
		system functions, this site intends to give you the know-how and the confidence to start 
		building your own computer. I would like to see more people discover, create and innovate
		in the ever-changing computing world to make computer technology more accessible.</p>
